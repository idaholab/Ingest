# Ingest

Ingest is desisgned to be the upload point for various data management solutions in the DOE space and beyond. It takes the place of Box and eventually Globus both. With an emphasis on gathering metadata along with the actual data, we hope that this tool becomes a powerhouse for enabling experiments to extract and collect data from various groups and sources more easily than before.

## Requirements
- Elixir 1.16.x
- Erlang OTP 27+
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) **optional** - used for managing Elixir/Erlang/OTP versions so that you can keep this project separate from your main installations
- [asdf-elixir](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) and [asdf-erlang](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) **optional**
- [Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) - should be installed if you use asdf
- Postgres 14+

## Installation
0. **optional** Navigate to the root of the project and run `asdf install` - this will install all the toolchain and language dependencies needed locally. (In order for VSCode's Elixir plugin to work you must also set the global erlang and elixir versions via `asdf global {erlang/elixir} {latest/version in .tool-versions}`)
1. Run `mix deps.get` & `mix deps.compile`
2. Install the `phx_new` generator - `mix archive.install hex phx_new`
3. Modify the configuration file in `config/dev.exs` - you will at least need to modify the database configuration to point to your local Postgres server.
5. Run `mix phx.gen.secret` and copy the output to line 42 in your `config/dev.exs` file - under `secret_key_base`
6. If you're on VSCode you can use the default run configuration to run your application from the editor, or you may start your server by running `mix server` in either your terminal or an iEX instance


## Common Problems and Solutions
- Mix can't find `rebar3` or fails to install `rebar3` via Hex: Download the [rebar3 binary](https://rebar3.org/) for your OS and put in a common location (`/usr/local/bin` for Unix systems). Then use this command to point Hex to `rebar3` - `mix local.rebar rebar3 path/to/rebar`
- CA Cert problems: Typically you'll see a failed `:httpc` library call and something about an unkown CA authority. The easier solution is to include an environment variable called `HEX_CACERTS_PATH` and set it to your root CA bundle. Another, less secure option, is to set `HEX_UNSAFE_HTTPS` to `1` and turn off SSL completely. Not recommended  
- More CA Cert Problems - modify the configuration file in `config/dev.exs` - you will see various places referring to your SSL cert store (default /etc/ssl/certs on Unix systems) - change those to point to your certificate bundle
- ElixirLS Problems - Two different solutions. Either make sure you are opening the project from the server directory or install hex globally. `mix archive.install github hexpm/hex branch latest` run this command in `/users/{YourName}` and `/Ingest/` directory.  

## Editor Setup
We recommend that you use either VSCode or Neovim for Elixir. 
[Setup for VSCode](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/setup-vscode-for-elixir-development/) (Make sure you also install the Credo extension)
[Setup for NeoVim](https://elixirforum.com/t/neovim-elixir-setup-configuration-from-scratch-guide/46310)

## Running
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
